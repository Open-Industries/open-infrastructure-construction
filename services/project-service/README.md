# Project Service

Bounded context: **Projects** — Infrastructure project registry.

Alignment: ISO 19650 project information posture. Lifecycle transitions take no body; secret identifiers,
where the domain has them, are masked at creation and never stored or returned in clear.
All data is synthetic.

| Item | Value |

| Owns data | Project records |
| Publishes | `project.created`, lifecycle events (see `contracts/asyncapi.yaml`) |

Run locally: `mvn -pl services/project-service quarkus:dev`.

# ADR-0004: The domain invariant is enforced in code

## Context

Every vertical has one rule whose violation destroys trust in the platform. Making it a tested code invariant — not documentation — is what makes this core a reference implementation.

## Decision

certified progress value on a project never exceeds its contract value — a progress certificate that would overrun it is rejected (422) and records nothing. The enforcement lives in the operations context's single write path, and the behavior is covered by automated tests (over-draw rejected with 422; state unchanged).

## Consequences

Callers must treat 422 as a normal business outcome; the API standard documents it.
